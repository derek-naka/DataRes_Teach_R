# DataRes_Teach_R
This repository has all of the examples and visualizations talked about during the meetings. I've also included all of the csv files that I've used for the projects in case you want to edit the code for yourself.

Teaching_R_EDA.Rmd contains information about different types of visualizations: bar graphs, pie plots, histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, etc. In addition, has the code for designing and styling the visualizations which are an important aspect to data science as well. 

Teaching_R_Shiny.Rmd contains information regarding R-Shiny and how to create a web-application using the R programming language.
